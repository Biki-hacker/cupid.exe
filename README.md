# Heart.exe 💖

**A cute, interactive mini web app that’s a love confession in disguise!**

This frontend-only project takes the user through a fun, playful experience:

1. Retro **terminal-style booting** with blinking logs.
2. **Progress bar** with flirty messages at 20% intervals.
3. Confetti and hearts when the “confession” is ready.
4. **Interactive scratchable love coupon cards** — pick one to reveal a personalized surprise.

Built with:

* **React.js (Vite)**
* CSS animations + optional Tailwind styling
* Canvas-based scratch card effect

**Extra touches:**

* Cute footer: “Site developed with 99% love and 1% caffeine, and unlimited patience for you ☕💖”
* Randomized coupon rewards for extra fun

A sweet little project for playful declarations and interactive surprises!
